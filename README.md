# PolarOS Notes
This program will be built on top the Electron framework. With a Chrome headless browser and Node to interact with the application and website. Most code will be located on one page to be-able to have a blurred glass look. The program will be a flat clean notes application. It will store the data in the browser database, like a cache. The HTML frame work I am building with be used on futrue projects so it will have to be carefully constructed. There will be a main editor and when you click a button it will open a side bar and make the editor smaller.

## Function List
 - `expand()` - opens side bar
 - `unexpand()` - closes the side bar
 - `openNote(id)` - opens a note with the id
 - `updateNote()` - save current open note
 - `addNote(name)` - adds note to database
    - `generateID()` - makes an id for a new note
 - `settingsOpen(boolean)` - opens or closes settings
 - `addNotePage(boolean)` - open or closes the new menu page
 - `openListNotes()` - generates the list of saved notes
    - `gatherInfo(i,callback_)` - get info about a current note in a for loop
 - `changeBottomMessage()` - adds a clever message at the bottom of the note page
      - `generateMessage(message)` - makes the html for the message
      - `grabMessage(list)` - grabs random message from list
      - `grabItem(list)` - grabs a random item to insert in message
 - `updatePos(id)` - adds the note id to the end of the array to keep a record of last updated notes
 - `updateTimeStampPos(id)` - updates the time stamp of the note
 - `openLastNote(wait)` - opens the last edited note when the application start
 - `timeStampID()` - makes an array with time info to make sorting by date easy
